# HELL INVADER

**HELL INVADER** is a simple shoot 'em up game where you shoot 'things' that are trying to kill you.
You also have to be careful with a wall that comes towards you, this wall speed up over time.
The purpose is to live and kill as many 'things' as possible. After death is displayed the score and the time survived.

## Consideration

This is my first college project. This is not a perfect project, it was created to study the java language through a development of a game.
It ended up exceeding my expectations and I was very happy with the result. All sprites were made by myself.
