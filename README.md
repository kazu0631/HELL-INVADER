# HELL INVADER

**HELL INVADER** is a simple shoot 'em up game where you shoot 'things' that are trying to kill you.
The purpose is to live and kill as many 'things' as possible. After death is displayed the score and the time survived.

## Consideration

This is my first college project. This project was created to study the java language through a development of a game.
It ended up exceeding my expectations and I was very happy with the completion of this project. All sprites made by myself.
